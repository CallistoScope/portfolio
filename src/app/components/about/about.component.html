      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Bruno Escobedo, a passionate software developer based in Lima, Peru.
          I am a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with a background in fiber optic projects, currently transitioning into the dynamic fields of software development and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in technical problem-solving, project management, and risk assessment, I bring a unique perspective to the challenges of protecting digital assets and better software development practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for cybersecurity has driven me to <span class="show-animation">obtain certifications such as [Name of Certifications],</span>
          learn about ethical hacking through <abbr title="Catch The Flag">CTF</abbr> platforms like <abbr title="Hack The Box">HTB</abbr> and <abbr title="TryHackMe">THM</abbr>,
          which helped me gain hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Metasploit and Kali Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I am deeply interested in software engineering and have been enhancing my skills through coding in various programming languages such as Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL,
          and using frameworks such as Angular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by a passion for protecting digital assets and developing robust software solutions, I am committed to continuous learning and eager to contribute to a proactive cybersecurity and software engineering team.
          My goal is to leverage my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to enhance information security, resilience, and software development practices.
